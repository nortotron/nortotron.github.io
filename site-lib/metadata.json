This is a classy unit that will let you understand the difference between analogue and digital processing. Eventide Propaganda:\nWe've been on a mission to create the ultimate and most versatile incarnation of the Bus Compressor ever. The bedrock of the design remains faithful to the original circuit and using this as the foundation, we've built upon it, adding several unique colouration options and advanced processing tools. If you need it to be clean and punchy like the SuperAnalogueTM&nbsp;9000 Series version, it can be. If you need it to be gritty and grungy like an early 4000E, it can do that also. Or if you need over-the-top, saturated, parallel compression for the drums, THE BUS+ has got you covered. THE BUS+ circuit design utilises high-grade components, including 2181 THAT VCAs for superior analogue performance, four modes of operation and 3 distinct compression colouration options which can be combined to perfectly suit the genre you’re working on. THE BUS+ also packs in sophisticated routing options and advanced processing tools: Dynamic Equaliser (D-EQ), Transient Expander and so much more…\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://solidstatelogic.com/products/the-bus-plus\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://solidstatelogic.com/products/the-bus-plus\" target=\"_self\">SSL Website</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"hardware/ssl-bus-+.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1743562930093,"modifiedTime":1768336352897,"sourceSize":1288,"sourcePath":"Hardware/SSL Bus +.md","exportPath":"hardware/ssl-bus-+.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":46,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"microphones/experiments/glockenspiel.html":{"title":"Glockenspiel","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"glockenspiel.png\" src=\"microphones/polar-patterns/attachments/glockenspiel.png\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"microphones/experiments/glockenspiel.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["microphones/polar-patterns/attachments/glockenspiel.html"],"createdTime":1741484652000,"modifiedTime":1743380100696,"sourceSize":21,"sourcePath":"Microphones/Experiments/Glockenspiel.md","exportPath":"microphones/experiments/glockenspiel.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":49,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"microphones/experiments/recording-experiment.html":{"title":"Recording Experiment","icon":"","description":"0ºMonoMid Side (MS)0º90º180º0º90º180º12Compare and Combine Stereo TechniquesThis setup can be achieved with 4 x AKG 414sThe Mid-Side provides a mono channel, and a stereo pair.The 1-2 provides a non-coincident stereo pairIn this example, the 1-2 setup is poorly considered.Consider AB with Omnidirectional for an actual stereotechnique.
